# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

```shell
address721 = '0x54868693F4DBc2ECd5fb22396cd2eFdDFCE05944' id = "1-5"
address1155 = '0x8f5A73D804efA9789928EC19E8cBC95EfA774077' id = "1-5"
```

```shell
https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/${address}/${id}
```
